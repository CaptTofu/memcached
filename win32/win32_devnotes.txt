Notes on building win32 memcached.exe...

Assume you're working in a c:/dev working directory.

First, you'll need git installed, after which you can...

- git clone git@github.com:CaptTofu/memcached.git memcached_win32

Then...

- git checkout --track origin/win32

Next, from mingw.org...

- install MinGW-5.1.6.exe
  - choose base tools, and options: g++
  - into c:\MinGW

- install MSYS (MSYS-1.0.11.exe)
  - into c:\msys\1.0
  - choose 'y' for all the post-install steps, and tell it about C:\MinGW

Next, are library dependencies...

- download and extract precompiled pthreads
  - http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/
  - look around for pthreads-w32-2-8-0-release.exe
  - create a subdir, such as with...
    - mkdir c:\dev\pthreads
    - download and run it in that subdir to extract files.

- download and extract libevent source
  - http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent-1.3e.tar.gz

- download and extract precompiled libevent binaries
  - see http://www.splinedancer.com/memcached-win32/
  - download it from...
    http://www.splinedancer.com/memcached-win32/libevent-1.3e-Win32.zip
  - unzip it to get the libevent.lib

Next, make a directory to hold all the dependencies.  This directory
will be a sibling to the memcached_win32 subdirectory.  That is, do...

  mkdir /c/dev/memcached_win32_deps

Copy all the *.h, *.a, *.lib, and *.dll files from pthreads*/**
into the memcached_win32_deps subdirectory.

Copy all the *.h, *.a, *.lib, and *.dll files from libevent*/**
into the memcached_win32_deps subdirectory.

Next, start a msys shell window...

  c:\msys\1.0\msys.bat

- in that msys shell (which will have a MINGW32 titlebar),
  change to the /c/dev/memcached_win32 directory.

  cd /c/dev/memcached_win32

Then...

  make -f Makefile.mingw
